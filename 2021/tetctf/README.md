# TetCTF 2021
I played casually solo as 'foon'. Not enough time to solve harder challenges but the challenges I took a look at were pretty neat.

| Category | Challenge | Points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web | [HPNY](hpny.md) | 100 |
| Web | [Super Calc](calc.md) | 100 |
| Web | [mysqlimit](mysqlimit.md) | 100 |
| Crypto | [uncollidable](uncollidable.py) | 728 |

I got kinda close with AMF1 but I struggled to build a deserialization payload myself and none of the ones I could find dealt with the filter, not enough knowledge with Java.

I'm not sure why the 2 stage unicast loaders wouldn't work, I could get the URLDNS payload in ysoserial to go but not any commands it seems.
