# PMB (Misc 50, 107 solves) 

The challenge lets us specify an interest rate (any number whos absolute value is less than 100) and repeatedly applies it with 0 money in our bank. The goal is to end with 10 million dollars.

Since it accepts any number, we can shove in a complex number like `-1+99j`.
