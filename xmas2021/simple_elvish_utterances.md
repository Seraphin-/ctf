# Simple Elvish utterances (misc 500)

The challenge is an image of what looks to be a flag written in a constructed language.

I am not sure why this has so few solves. The flag is written in toki pona, specifically [this font](https://jackhumbert.github.io/sitelen-pona-pona/). Recreating the image as is gives the flag.

## Flag
`X-MAS{toki! sina li pona tawa mi}`
